# Alyanna's Todos
1. Add validation for `options` parameter.
  - Function must be called in one of two ways:
  - 1. `options` exists and is an object
    - if it's not an object, throw an error
  - 2. or, `options` doesn't exist
    - set `options = {}`
2. Sync code to GitHub
3. Make pull request

(For Danny: Remove Alyanna as admin on `jschemer` repository.)
