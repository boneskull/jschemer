* Create a JavaScript file in the `learning` folder called render.js.
* Goal: Use the command `node render.js` to run the file, so that it takes the data from `data.json` and uses the template in `gogauchos.hbs` to create a new HTML page.
* Use Handlebars package to create HTML from the template.
* Save the HTML as a new file `learning/gogauchos.html`.

The way to include the Handlebars package in your script is `const hbs = require('handlebars')`.
hbs.compile().....
